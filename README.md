# Data Science Portfolio

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes. This portfolio also contains certificates, skills and Achievements. It is updated on the regular basis.


### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, MATLAB

## Education
- Ph.D., Physics | Universidad de Buenos Aires - Argentina (_April 2016_)								       		             		
- Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Physics | Universidad del Valle - Colombia (_November 2009_)

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Toyota Financial Services (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses

**Data Science Consultant @ Shawhin Talebi Ventures LLC (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

## Projects
### Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
[Publication](https://github.com/andresariasduran/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone)

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, costing $62 million; other vendors cost upwards of $165 million each, much of the savings being because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. So, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. In this final project, we predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.



### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
